<p class="justify">It’s a scary thought that we’re alone in this universe. Some might say it’s scary if we’re NOT alone,
but I don’t think so. Imagine living in a small tent in a desert with your friends. The vast land of nothing as far as your eyes reach.
You’re safe and happy with friends. At first you might feel special for being the only people there, but soon one thought will start bothering you.
“You’re alone and abandoned here!” If something out of your power comes along to threaten life of you and your friends, there is nobody to help you.
You can’t believe that in this endless wilderness, this is the only place one can live and no one has ever did this before during past millions of years ago.
It’s such a waste of space and time! You start to believe it’s a random coincidence with tiny probability for you to be there.
And your tent might be completely wiped out someday, according to the same probability. It’s fucking scary to me! Let alone for those who leave this safe place to explore the outside.

I think if there is something alive out there, it’s definitely as scared, desperate and curious as us.
They won’t ever hurt us unless we try to hurt them first. The moment of contact will be exciting and glorious for them too, since they found someone else in this universe to share their loneliness with.
They were on this mission for centuries probably and finally they got lucky. They won’t need our resources, as we don’t need theirs either.
There’s not going to be a war with them, instead it’ll be a giant party in the universe. As silly as this sounds, I hope I be alive when this happens.</p>
