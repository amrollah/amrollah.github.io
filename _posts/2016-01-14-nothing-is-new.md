<p class="justify">

I think we reached a point in human history where there is nothing new to say. It seems all the possible concepts have been said before by someone else in some way. In my eye, all the new philosophy, is just another refurbished version of old ones, cleaned up so we think it’s new and humanity is moving forward. There’s no new word, no new poem, no new song, no new movie, no new photo, no new book, and <b>no new person</b>. Looks like we stopped evolving some time ago, and since then we’re just mixing our available cards in a desperate move to disrupt the world and believe we’ve came up with something new. All the current and future technological advancements have been imagined decades ago, and all the different people have lived on earth before. There’s nothing new here anymore. <br>And even this thought has been said before by numerous people!
