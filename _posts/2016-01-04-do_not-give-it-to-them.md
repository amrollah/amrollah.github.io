We all give fucks about things every day. So, let's be honest and don't deny it. But I have a hypothesis for this concept. I think there is a law when it comes to number of fucks which we can potentially give throughout day. It seems to be a fixed number for everyone,
say 10 or so. Assume there is fuck-gland in your body which produces this number of fucks every day. Think of the fucks as a universal currency which can be traded between people; I mean exchange of fuck for fuck.
You can give a person some of your fucks and that person can give you some fucks back, but not necessarily the same amount. Also, interestingly your happiness is profoundly correlated to amount of fucks you currently posses, which is sum of all your daily fucks
 - fucks you gave away + fucks you earned from others. Most of people give many of their fucks to public figures and celebrities while these people barely give any fucks back to them. So, effectively they're getting drained of fucks while celebrities are
 swimming in a fuck pool.
 Some people often don't give any fucks to anything, and as a result they are alone and living like a monk with their own fucks. Parents usually save most of their fucks for their kids, even though they don't get as many fucks back from them. Usually parents try to compensate that by
 reducing the fucks from other parts, say work and etc. That's why sometimes people get pets, in order to compensate for those lack of fucks. A dog for example is very fuck-efficient. You give it one fuck, and it gives you three fucks at least. It's because they don't have to give fucks to work or society, so they can afford to
  spend them on you without getting sad due to shortage of fucks.
  Lovers are usually very happy, since they're sharing their fucks all the time, as there is a continues exchange of fucks between them. It's like almost doubling their fuck repository. Good friends have the same effect to some extend.
 I suppose volunteers for humanitarian causes are happy too, since they spend a small portion of fucks there but get a lot of fucks from the relieved people. That's the power of numbers I guess. In work place, you usually get some fucks from your co-workers and managers, and
  you give some fucks back as well. I tend to keep this trade balanced at work place!
 After all, you can spend your fucks however you wish, but remember to think like a bushiness man in these trades. Don't spend them where you won't get a good deal.
